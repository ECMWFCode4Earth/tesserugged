# Readme file for the simple python verification script

The verification script Add_03.... performs a simple spatial verification of original ERA5 (interpolated to the CERRA grid) and the downscaled ERA5 data using different models. It is driven by the config_Verification.ini file.
All paths are set in the config file and need to be adapted to the respective structure.

Mind, here using full paths in the config just so (and because I like to have a full path written in my verification so that errors are identified easily).
